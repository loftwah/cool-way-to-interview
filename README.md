## Technical Interview - Dean Lofts

Hello Dean!

You've successfully moved to the next stage of our interview process - the technical interview. Congratulations!

At [Operoo](https://operoo.com), our aim is to design the interview process around your success. We understand that candidates have different methods that best showcase their skills and strengths.

Therefore, we've created three distinct paths for our technical interviews. Please **study these before your interview** and inform us which path suits you best!

## Option 1: The Traditionalist

_tl;dr - classic algorithm puzzles, similar to those on Leetcode_

Many engineers hone their skills on platforms like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (Hint: _most of our problems will be inspired by AoC_). If this resonates with your preparation style, this might be your ideal path!

We don't want you to worry about the environment for the coding challenge, so you're free to screen share and select your preferred platform. If you have no preference, we'll gladly set up a CodeSandbox for you!

You can provide working solutions or pseudo-code, whichever you're comfortable with!

**Remember - our aim isn't to assess how quickly you come up with the correct answer. We're more interested in understanding your working style and communication skills.**

### General Structure

* About 15 minutes of general tech + team experience questions

  * Example: "Could you share an instance when you encountered a technical problem that was more challenging than you had initially anticipated? How did you discover the issue? How did you communicate any changes to your team, if you were part of one?"

* Approximately 30-45 minutes of coding puzzle

  * Can be pseudo-coded or actual code

* Remaining time for questions about Operoo, role expectations, etc

## Option 2: The Pragmatist

_tl;dr - similar to the above but with a realistic code problem_

We believe in making interviews as reflective of the actual job as possible. This path focuses on that idea üôÇ

The problems will vary in terms of type and complexity, depending on the role and level you're interviewing for. If you're uncertain about what type of problem you might face after reading the examples below, please reach out to your recruiter for more clarity before your interview!

### Example problems

Mid-Senior DevOps: Problem related to AWS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, EC2, RDS, Elasticache, S3, SNS/SQS, Lambda, Terraform, GitHub, GitHub Actions, and Jira (Detailed problem coming soon)

### General Structure

* About 15 minutes of general tech + team experience questions
* Approximately 30-45 minutes of role-related code challenge
* Remaining time for questions about Operoo, role expectations, etc

## Option 3: The Realist

_tl;dr - Bring Your Own Repo, we'll observe your work_

This is our unconventional option and we're quite excited about it!

Do you have a side project you're proud of? An outdated website that needs a refresh? An open source library where you'd like to add a feature? Let's pair up!

If this option excites you, **please select a project and email your recruiter about it beforehand!** Bonus points if it's open source! Please refrain from bringing work from any current or previous employer üôè

### General Structure

* 5-10 minute introduction to the project and your reasons for choosing it
* 10-15 minute overview of the codebase and discussion of what we'll be working on
* \~30 minutes of collaboratively adding a new feature, fixing a bug, or working on a chosen aspect of the project
* Remaining time for questions about Operoo, role expectations, etc

## Option _n:_ The Specialist

_tl;dr - Bring Your Own Interview Plan_

At Operoo, we're constantly looking to evolve and enhance our interview process. If you have suggestions for ways we can modify, combine, or create new interview paths, please don't hesitate to share them! If you'd like to construct a custom interview path with us, **please reach out to your recruiter at least a week before your interview so we have ample time to plan with you!**

# What's Next?

If you have decided which path you'd like to take, **please email your recruiter and inform them**. If you're still contemplating, feel free to discuss with us the options you're considering, and we're more than happy to assist you in selecting the most suitable one.

Remember - **our main goal is to facilitate you in giving your best performance**. If there's anything else we can do to support you, don't hesitate to let us know!!!
